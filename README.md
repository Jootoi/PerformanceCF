# High-Performance Library for Collaborative Filtering

Repository is created for Recomender Systems course as part of the course project.

It implements a iterative latent factor model for recomendations as well as some simple sparse matrix based operations that can become handy while doing collaborative filtering.
The parts requiring high perfromance are implemented in C++ with the assistance of Eigen linear algebra library.
For easier usage the main functionality is also wrapped to be used with python.
